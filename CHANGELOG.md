# Changelog



## `v2.0.0`

This release is a major refactoring, with many metrics and parameters changing
names. Read the documentation in the [README](README.md).

* **BREAKING CHANGE:** the JSON metrics format now has a `metrics` property
  which is an array of JSON metric objects, instead of each metric being
  attached directly to the top level.



## `v1.0.3`

* First working version
